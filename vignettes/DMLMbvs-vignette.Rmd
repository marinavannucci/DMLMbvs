# Tutorial 
Tutorial for the R package DMLMbvs, as described in ``A Bayesian model of microbiome data for simultaneous identification of covariate associations and prediction of phenotypic outcomes,'' by M.D. Koslovsky, K. Hoffman, C. Daniel-MacDougall, and M. Vannucci
Having installed and loaded the package into the R environment, generate a simulated data set using the `simualate_DMLM()' function.
